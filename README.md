# XenoAddon /-/ Cameron's Core
Core addon for all of the addons that I make for XenoPanel. This repo is NOT meant to be used in production. If you want the addon, please visit the market-place.

# **NOTICE**
This is currently an not working version. This is being developed with pre-B14 APIv2 information provided by Liam. **THIS DOES NOT WORK AT ALL AT THE MOMENT**

You can view the list of shit that I'm waiting on [here](https://houston.xenopanel.com/d/52-apiv2-method-class-and-utilities-requests).
